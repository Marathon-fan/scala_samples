Some days ago, I saw Adam in Salesforce team was preparing a ppt called CRM introduction. In his ppt, it was said CRM was using AI and BI technology. Then I came across a funny technical phrase: AI, BI, CI and DI. 

AI: artificial intelligence
BI: business intelligence 
CI: continuous integration
DI: dependency injection

Interesting or not?
